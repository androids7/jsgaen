# JSatch's Game Framework

## Inspiration

Framework based (not so heavily) in the way that Android
handles UI user interaction. It used composite and state design pattern for ui components and UI flow (screens)
respectively.

## Main Objectives

- Easy to use
- Portable (works in OSX, Win and Linux)

## Techonologies

- Uses SDL2 for managing images and rendering issues.
- Uses Cmake for managing of the project tasks.
